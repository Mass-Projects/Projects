[How to update the CAD](https://youtu.be/RV6KeeN4AA4)

1. Open Command Prompt
2. Run `git clone https://github.com/Dev-CasperTheGhost/snaily-cadv3`
3. Run `cd snaily-cadv3`
4. Run `npm run auto-install` and wait it to finish
5. Open the `server` folder
6. Make a copy of `config.example.ts` and rename to `config.ts`
7. Modify that where needed
8. Go back to your command prompt
9. Once done modifying, create a new database in XAMPP phpmyadmin, call it `snaily-cad` or whatever you called it in the config file
10. Import `snaily-cad.sql` into that database
11. Go back to your command prompt and make sure you are in the main folder (snaily-cadv3/)
12. Run `npm start`, this will start both client and server
13. Wait a few seconds until it logs "CAD IS RUNNING ON \<port\>"
14. The CAD should be running on <http://localhost:3030> by default

## Troubleshooting

- I get an error saying that `ts-node is not found/not a command`

  - run `npm install -g ts-node`

- I get an error saying `cannot find module dotenv/config`

  - run `cd server && npm install dotenv`

- I try to run `/callxxx` but it won't show up in the CAD/MDT

  - Make sure that you've configured the config in `server.lua` in the download

- I followed the steps for updating the CAD, but still says it's outdated!
  - 1: Run: `git stash` in the root folder of the CAD/MDT
  - 2: Follow the rest of the update steps
  - 3: Should be updated
